# The Process is Nothing
An animated remake of [The Apex is Nothing](https://www.wikiart.org/en/alfred-jensen/the-apex-is-nothing-1960) by Alfred Jensen, 1960, using p5.js. Jensen's painting arranges Mayan numerals (base-20 or vigesimal) in a symmetrical X-shaped pattern.

The main code lives in sketch.js which animates the "painting" of the work while revealing the underlying numerical pattern and the code loop sequence.
